# Titanic EDA Project

This project is all about exploring the Titanic dataset using Python. I used Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn to clean the data, analyze it, and make some cool visualizations.

The goal was to understand the passengers and survival rates better. No machine learning models here — just data cleaning and analysis.

## Dataset

I used the Titanic dataset from the seaborn library. It has info like age, sex, class, fare, and whether passengers survived or not.

---

## What I Did

* Dropped columns that weren’t useful (like deck)
* Filled missing values (age with median, embark\_town with mode)
* Removed duplicates (177 rows)
* Removed outliers from age and fare

---

## Analysis

* Looked at single variables (age, sex, survived) using histograms and countplots
* Compared age by sex with histograms
* Checked survival rates by sex and class with grouped bar plots

---

Got it! Here’s a smoother and clearer rewrite of those sections for you:

---

## Visualizations

Created various plots using Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize and better understand the data.

---

## Feature Scaling

Applied StandardScaler from Scikit-learn to scale the following columns: age, fare, sibsp, and parch.

---

## What’s Next?

This project focuses on data cleaning and exploratory analysis only. I plan to work on machine learning models in a separate project later.

---

## Libraries Used

* pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* scikit-learn

## How to Run

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open the `Titanic_EDA_Project.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
3. Run all the notebook cells in order
